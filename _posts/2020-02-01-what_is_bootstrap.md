title: What is Bootstrap?

Bootstrap was one of those words I heard a lot but never really knew what it was. I had never used it in my day to day work and just assumed it was just another piece of infrastructure. Essentially Bootstrap is a giant collection of handy, reusable bits of code written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It comes with a grid system, components and templates, all amazing features for building user interfaces quickly - and preserving my sanity. 

It turns out that I had been using something very similar to Bootstrap in my regular work. When developing user interfaces, the various programmes at GDS utilise the ‘GOV.UK Design System’ to ensure that the look of our applications remains consistent. Using this system also cuts down on the repetition of work and gives developers confidence that the elements they are introducing are backed by previous user research.

Unfortunately, using the design system is not simply a matter of copy/pasting the relevant bits of code to where they are required. It certainly provides developers with a foundation, but often the elements will have to be tailored to work the way that is desired. I found out that this is also applicable with Bootstrap, far from being effortless Bootstrap seemed to be equally fiddly when I tried applying it to one of my side projects. 

I cannot deny however the quality and accessibility of their components. Things such as generating a navbar at the top of a webpage would have been very hard for me to implement alone, especially in a way that utilities javascript in such a seamless way. The grid system was a bit confusing for me but i’m sure it is more my inexperience than an issue with the gem. I think I will use bootstrap in future projects, I think having that foundation and being able to make small custom changes to the CSS and javascript of my site will feel easier to handle and more conducive to learning.
