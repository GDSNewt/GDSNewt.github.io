title: Writing user stories

In my work much of the planning and analysis of our services is performed by delivery managers and technical leads, consequently there has not been as much scope for me to develop this skill, as I have the more technical elements. Nonetheless, I thought it important that I demonstrated that I was comfortable with elements of the analytical process, such as user stories, and that I was capable of creating them myself. 

One of the teams I had worked on wanted to launch a private beta on our service before it was released in a much wider public beta. It was important that we collect as much useful information in the private beta as possible. To this end we looked at various tools and software that would provide us with an analysis of user behaviour; one such tool was Google Analytics(GA)

We first carried out a spike to determine the viability of using GAs, our findings were positive and confirmed that we could indeed use the tool. It was decided that we should implement GA at the earliest opportunity. I took responsibility for writing the user story that would address this work. 

I started off by addressing who the user was and what they wanted to gain from this piece of work. This was relatively straightforward, given the users were my team, but I thought it worthwhile laying out the card like this regardless, as it would focus the work in my teamâ€™s mind and also help other teams working on our service know why we were carrying out this work. 

We had already established how exactly this work would be carried out in the earlier spike that we had carried out. I therefore inserted a link to an earlier card that the team had produced which had in depth instructions for the team to follow. 

The final aspect to cover then was the acceptance criteria, i.e how we would know when the work was done. In assessing the acceptance criteria I first discussed what was possible for us to measure, on GA, with the developers who had carried out the spike. Once I had established the technical limitations I then discussed the matter with my delivery manager and policy adviser; with their help we agreed upon a set of criteria that would prove useful in assessing the success and function of the private beta. 

I then added a checklist to the bottom of my user story listing the metrics that we wanted GA to measure. As it was confirmed that each of these metrics were recorded with GA the developer implementing the work could then tick the checkboxes off.

In my junior role I have spent many hours trying to understand the users of work, but I did not spend much time articulating these views for the consumption of others. I am not particularly daunted by the prospect of doing this, indeed I feel fairly comfortable putting myself in the shoes of the users, but there is definitely something to be gained in the writing of user stories, and larger analytical pieces. 

I think it does give you a better appreciation of your objectives and why you are doing the work you are doing, this is helpful not only from a morale perspective, but also in keeping me focused. It is particularly useful when paired with Agile methodologies as it can protect against potential negative behaviour, such as feature creep. That is, implementing features outside of the original specifications that may not be necessary.
