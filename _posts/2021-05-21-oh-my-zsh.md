title: Oh my Zsh

While working on tickets it has sometimes been the case that I would lose track of what git branch I was working on and I would accidentally commit changes to the wrong branch, or even worse the master branch, fortunately this doesn’t have major consequences but it can be a bit of a headache to fix. In my pairing sessions with other developers I noticed that their terminals would sometimes have UI elements telling them which branch they were on, amongst other useful pieces of information. I thought it would be a good idea to modify my terminal to emulate this.

After doing some research I decided to implement zsh & oh my zsh on iterm.

I changed the theme of my terminal to a cool dark one, which means i’m a proper developer, I then used vim to edit the ~/.zshrc file. In this file you can state which of the oh my zsh plugins you would like to use, there are an intimidating number of plugins located here.

After making these changes and picking a theme I liked I was now able to see additional information about the file structure and which branch I was on. Which will hopefully help me to avoid some of the headaches associated with git.
