title: Vs Code useful extensions

Having upgraded my terminal I looked into other options for upgrading the programming experience. I learnt that my code editor, vs code, has a number of extensions which provide the user with helpful features. 

While pairing with other developers I come across the practice of using TODO comments to keep track of work. I had begun utilising them in my solo efforts but, ironically, I would sometimes forget I had placed them in my code and would have to actively search for the uses of TODO to remind myself. While not a massive inconvenience, it was an additional thing to have to think about and I thought it would be good if I could reduce this mental burden. 

I found the following extensions which would help me with this.

The descriptions above rather concisely describe how they help you keep track of comments. Having very clear reminders, whether it be in the form of highlighted text or as reminders in the tree view, greatly reduced the mental exhaustion I experienced when coding. 

Another extension I came across was Gitlens, I had seen this in use again when pairing. In that instance it had been useful because it allowed us to identify which commit in our repo’s history was responsible for introducing a bit of code we then had to edit. This is a very valuable thing to do as it allowed us to examine the rationale behind the commit and gain insight that we did not have previously.

Now when I looked at projects I had the git history of each file readily available in just one click.

Finally I install perhaps the most valuable plugin…

Now I could finally give my colleagues the praise their code deserved.
